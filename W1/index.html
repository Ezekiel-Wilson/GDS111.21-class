    <p class="beepo"> Hello I am a platypus! I am very cool and like to swim. Dont try to eat me as I excrete extremely venousmous poison. I can deliver a mega-sting that causes immediate excruciating pain. Similar to hundreds of hornet stings at once. Leaving a victim incapacitated for weeks. SO DONT TOUCH ME!</p>
    
    <br>

    <p class="beepo">I like to eat shrimp and other crustaceans. I only come out during the early morning and evening. I hunt using my bill as it can detect electrical currents in the water. A cool fact about me I don't have a stomach. My esophagus is directly connected to my intestine. If you ever see me in the wild dont approach me unless you got some shirmp.</p>
